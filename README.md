<h2> About Me </h2>

At my core, I love to create and learn systems, overcome challenges, and deeply connect with other people. To contribute to the economy, I develop full-stack web applications. My main goal in my career is to use my skills to objectively improve the wellbeing of communities and the people that make them up.


<br>
Here are some of the techonologies I utilize to build web apps:

- **Front-end**: JavaScript, React, Material-UI, SASS, D3.js, and Tailwind

- **Back-end**: NodeJS, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, AWS, and Heroku

- **Developer tooling**: Git and GitHub for version control, Markdown for documentation, Webpack for module bundling, Jest, Enzyme, and Cypress for software testing, Linux and Bash for administration and scripting, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for app containerization, and Rollbar for Error Logging and Tracking
