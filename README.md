<h2> About Me </h2>

I believe that every human being is fundamentally the same as me. Same core, different experience. Same desire for happiness, different perspective on what it means to achieve it. But nonetheless, same desire. Through this view of the world and my gratitude for the opportunities I have been given in life, I want to give back to the world and its communities. And, I want to leverage my analytical and technical skills to do so. 

<h2> Currently Learning </h2>

I’m currently learning JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, TDD, and other server-side concepts in Codecademy's [Back-End Engineer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path) Career Path.
